# Image Customization Guide

## For Your Personal Website

The HTML files in this website use placeholder images from Unsplash. To customize with your own images:

1. Add your own images to the "images" folder
2. Replace the Unsplash URLs in the HTML files with local paths to your images

Example:
- Instead of: `url("https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?workspace,modern,desk")`
- Use: `url("images/your-image.jpg")`

## Recommended Image Sizes

- Hero section images: 1600x900 pixels
- Project thumbnails: 600x400 pixels
- Profile/About images: 800x600 pixels

## Sample Image File

For demonstration purposes, you can add an actual image file with:
- Name: profile.jpg
- Location: images/profile.jpg
- Size: 400x400 pixels
